# Improved Media Controls

Enhances GNOME's own media controls instead of replacing them: a now-playing
indicator in the top bar that raises the player when clicked, and a **seek bar
plus shuffle and loop** added to the native media notifications in the date
menu _and_ on the lock screen, with support for multiple players.

This started as a simple fork of [Medialine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/10076/medialine/) for some personal adjustments, which is why it has the same icon right now, but quickly turned into it's own thing later. I'll keep the icon until I get a better one.

## What it does

**Top bar** - a compact now-playing label (title / artist / album, configurable).
Long text **marquee-scrolls** within a max width instead of being cut off with
"…". Click it to **raise the player app** (click/scroll actions are configurable).

**Notifications** - rather than inserting a separate widget, it augments the
_native_ MPRIS media message that GNOME already shows. So it keeps the native
look, app name + icon, and lock-screen support (GNOME 49+), and adds on top:

- a draggable **seek bar** with elapsed / total time,
- **shuffle** and **loop** (None → Track → Playlist) toggles.

Because these are the real notifications, multiple players each get their own
native message, and the "No notifications" placeholder behaves correctly.

## Install

```sh
make install
```

Wayland can't reload the shell live, so **log out and back in**, then enable it:

```sh
gnome-extensions enable improved-media-controls@m-obeid.github.com
```

(or use the Extensions app). Preferences:

```sh
gnome-extensions prefs improved-media-controls@m-obeid.github.com
```

## Preferences

- **General** - show in the top bar, enhance notifications (either or both).
- **Display** - icon source (album art / app icon / playback status) & size,
  label fields, separator, and max label width (longer text marquee-scrolls).
- **Panel** - top-bar section and position index.
- **Mouse** - click and scroll actions (left-click defaults to _Raise player_).
